### Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jasfre/gcc-cyclistic-case-study-present-report-prompt
### Dataset Size: 3 GB
The chosen dataset is of a bike sharing company based in chicago called Cyclistic. The  dataset consists of information of all the rides taken using different types of bikes by various citizens recently during the period of 12/2021 to 11/2022. The data is stored in CSV files where there is an individual CSV file present for trips taken each month.

### Business Problem or Opportunity, Domain Knowledge:
The Cyclistic Bike Share dataset provides us with valuable information about the usage of bikes in the bike-sharing industry. A potential business problem or opportunity that this dataset could be used to address is the optimization of Cyclistic's marketing strategy to attract more riders and increase revenue. There are several factors that can affect bike ridership, including weather conditions, day of the week, and time of day. By analyzing the data, we could identify patterns and trends in rider behavior and preferences, such as the most popular start and end stations, peak riding times, and trip lengths. We can also find which type of bike is mostly used, electric, casual bike or docked bike. Analyzing these factors can help us identify patterns in the dataset and understand how they impact bike usage. For example, we might find that bike usage is higher on weekdays than weekends or the usage is higher in the morning than evening etc. This kind of analysis can help bike-sharing companies to make more bikes available during those times.
To conduct our analysis, we will be using AWS S3 to store the dataset's CSV files, Amazon Quicksight to create interactive visualizations, and Amazon Sagemaker for data preparation and analysis. By leveraging these powerful AWS tools, we can efficiently extract meaningful insights from the Cyclistic Bike Share dataset to drive business growth and enhance the overall bike-sharing experience.

### Research Objectives and Questions: 
1) Which bike type is most used among the casual ,docked and    electric bikes?
2) Which weekday is preferable for people to ride the bike?
3) What is the peak time during the weekday that people use the bike?
4) What types of bikes are preferred by different customer types?
5) What is the average time of ride for each bike type?
6) How does the demand for bike rides vary across different months and days of the week based on start date and time?
7) Is there a difference in the duration of rides between members and casual riders?
8) What will be the rate of customers preferring electric bikes in the next 5 years?
9) What will be the most demandable locations for the next 3 years?
